### **Project Overview**

**1. `main.c`**
- **Purpose**: Handles user interactions and displays the menu.
- **Features**: Prompts user for actions, processes choices, and manages user input validation.

**2. `student.c`**
- **Purpose**: Implements core functionalities for managing student data.
- **Features**: Add, update, delete student records, display details, search by ID, calculate average GPA, and identify the highest GPA.

**3. `student.h`**
- **Purpose**: Defines function prototypes and structures.
- **Features**: Includes standard libraries, defines `student_data` structure for student info, and declares functions for managing records.

### **Key Functionalities**
- **Add Student**: Input and store student details with duplicate ID checks.
- **Display Students**: View all student records.
- **Search by ID**: Quickly find a student by ID.
- **Update Records**: Modify student details.
- **Delete Records**: Remove student records.
- **Calculate Average GPA**: Compute the average GPA of all students.
- **Find Highest GPA**: Identify the student with the highest GPA.

### **Technical Highlights**
- **Data Structure**: Utilizes a linked list for dynamic student record management.
- **Error Handling**: Robust input validation ensures stability.
- **Memory Management**: Efficient allocation and deallocation of resources.

This project showcases my ability to design and implement a dynamic data management system, emphasizing clean code practices and effective use of data structures.
